# GWeather
A weather app developed for the Handheld Devices classes. I have prior Android experience from my graduate research, however
I had never really worked with proper UI design before. So, I used this project as opportunity to learn Google's Material Design and how to use the Android
Support Library to bring Material Design features to pre-Lollipop devices. Automated image fetching using an API like Picasso was also
new to me. Finally, I practiced proper code structure and even experimented with some basic unit testing in Android using Robotium and Mockito.

## Quick Start
The API dependencies are taken care of by the build.grade file, however Apache HTTP Components have been deprecated as of Android API 23 (Marshmallow), so the current target SDK is API 22.
