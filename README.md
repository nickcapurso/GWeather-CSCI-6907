# GWeather
A weather app developed for the Handheld Devices classes. I used the opportunity to learn Material Design and the 
Support Library, Picasso, proper code structure, and even some introductory unit testing.

## Quick Start
The API dependencies are taken care of by the build.grade file, however Apache HTTP Components have been deprecated as of Android API 23 (Marshmallow), so the current highest-supported SDK and Build Tools level is API 22.
